# Electrolysis For Oxygen Production

In this section, we look at the feasibility of oxygen generation
through electrolysis methods.

## Progress
The amount of Oxygen produced is too little for a COVID patient.
It takes about 15 minutes to produce 1 lt. of oxygen at standard
atmospheric pressure & temperature at 20A current.
